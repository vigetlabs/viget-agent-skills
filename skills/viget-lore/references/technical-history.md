# Technical History

## The ColdFusion Era

Before Rails, Viget was building sites in **ColdFusion and SQL Server**. A 2004
Georgetown University project featured a hybrid Flash/HTML design on this stack.
Flash/HTML hybrids were considered cutting-edge at the time.

## Early Rails Adoption

Viget was an early and enthusiastic adopter of **Ruby on Rails**. When
ComputerWorld named Rails the **"#1 Technology You Need to Know About in 2007"**,
Viget had already adopted it as their primary framework.

Key moments:
- **Chad Fowler** (Ruby community luminary) was brought in to train the team
- **Ben Scofield** advocated internally for Rails adoption and presented at
  **RailsConf 2007**: "Building and Working with Static Sites in Ruby on Rails"
- Team members attended **RailsEdge Conference** in 2007
- One early Rails project was **funside.com**

The team's philosophy: Rails allowed them to "focus less on the repetitive
mindless grunt work of web development and more on the elegant problem-solving
part of it."

## Early BDD and Testing Culture

Clinton Dreisbach experimented with **behavior-driven development (BDD)** during
the Rails 2 era, evaluating tools like RSpec and test/spec. When Rails 2 broke
their preferred testing framework, they dug into framework internals and
engineered a workaround rather than abandoning testing.

## GitHub Early Adopters

David Eisinger published the **EmailLabsClient** gem on GitHub in **July 2008**
-- just three months after GitHub launched in April 2008. Viget was among the
platform's earliest adopters and had an open-source ethos baked into their
engineering culture from the start.

## Mobile Web Pioneers (2008)

Viget built an iPhone-optimized version of viget.com in 2008, just one year
after the iPhone launched. They used it to experiment with CSS3, jQuery, and
AJAX techniques. Being on the frontier of mobile web before most companies were
even thinking about it.

## Healthy Skepticism

Mark Cornick captured the engineering team's pragmatic ethos when evaluating the
Passenger/Mod Rails deployment tool: **"After a decade-plus in IT, I'm skeptical
of hype and twice as skeptical of benchmarks."**

## Early Agile Adoption (2008)

Viget was practicing Agile software development -- releasing software early and
often to gather user feedback -- as early as 2008. Brian Williams wrote about
balancing agility with a clear, unwavering core vision.

## Ahead-of-Their-Time Takes

**Twitter defense (June 2009)**: When media was publishing "dismal Twitter
statistics," Paul Koch argued Twitter was "moving into an untapped niche as an
information aggregator" -- remarkably prescient.

**"Site Experience Optimization" (2007)**: Ken Yarmosh promoted SEO that
considered both algorithms and humans -- essentially modern UX-focused SEO,
years before it was mainstream.

**Facebook Connect potential (December 2008)**: Ryan Moede predicted it would
give digital marketers a "huge opportunity in 2009," just months after the
platform launched.

**Groupon mention (2009)**: Laura Dec recommended a then-obscure startup called
**Groupon** as a money-saving tool -- years before it became a household name
and went public.
