# Culture and Traditions

## The CEO Builds Conference Tables

Brian Williams is described as someone who does "everything from advising our
clients to building our conference tables." The image of the CEO literally
building the furniture the team works on captures the maker culture at Viget's
core.

## Sketching in Kickoff Meetings

Jackson Fox introduced a practice of handing clients pens and paper during
kickoff meetings and asking them to **draw their dream website**. The 25-45
minute exercise deliberately used thick markers to prevent over-detailing. This
saved time on wireframing and improved client satisfaction.

## "Constraint Over Creativity"

Former Design Director Peyton Crump articulated a core philosophy: **"constraint
-- not creativity -- should be the overriding drive behind our designs."** This
reflects a distinction between artists (who express themselves) and designers
(who solve problems), with Viget firmly valuing the latter.

## "A Vibrant Community with a Little Bit of Riff-Raff"

Jackson Wilkinson argued against heavy-handed content moderation, favoring
authentic engagement. He wrote it was better to have "a vibrant community with a
little bit of riff-raff" than a dead, over-moderated space.

## Thought Leadership as Culture

Across the entire archive (2003-2010+), Viget employees at every level --
developers, strategists, designers, the CEO -- were actively publishing
substantive blog content. This wasn't bolted on later; writing and
knowledge-sharing was embedded in the company's DNA from the beginning.

## Internal Projects for Learning

Viget regularly undertook **"numerous internal projects aimed to expand our
expertise"** throughout the year. The iPhone-optimized viget.com (2008) was built
not because a client asked for it, but because the team wanted to learn mobile
web development -- one year after the iPhone launched.

## The "Lists of 50" Year-End Tradition

In late 2006, Peyton Crump wrote a reflective year-end piece reviewing industry
trends and company goals using a "Lists of 50" format, describing it as
"overwhelming, inspiring, exciting, and laughable in some cases." This suggests
a tradition of ambitious year-end goal-setting.

## Ken Yarmosh's Red Sox Joke

Strategist Ken Yarmosh, writing about targeted advertising in 2007, added a
personal aside about how he would boycott any advertiser who sent him Boston Red
Sox content, despite having attended school in Boston. This kind of personality
in blog posts reflects a culture that encouraged individual voice.

## "iPad Looks Like a Broken Laptop"

Kevin Powers described using an iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard in 2010 as
"looking like a laptop that's been broken in two" -- a fun time capsule of early
tablet-era work life.

## Jason Fried Influence

Brian Williams was influenced by Jason Fried of 37signals (now Basecamp), whose
philosophy on simplicity and sustainable business models shaped Viget's approach
to product development.
