# Side Projects and Internal Tools

## Pointless Corp.

Viget operated a side venture called **Pointless Corp.** (`pointlesscorp.com`),
a subsidiary dedicated to building fun, experimental web applications outside
of client work. The name alone is peak Viget personality. It is referenced
across many articles, suggesting it was a meaningful part of the company's
culture -- a space for building things just because they were interesting.

### Known Pointless Corp. Projects

**SpeakerRate** (January 2009) -- A community platform connecting event
speakers, attendees, and organizers. It was designed to solve the "cold start
problem" of community sites by being useful even with minimal users. Brian
Williams personally wrote the launch announcement.

**HeyCraig** (2009) -- A Craigslist monitoring tool that notified users when
desired items became available. One testimonial praised it for helping users
"find what I need without getting distracted by ridiculous things like missed
connections and free dirt."

**FeedStitch** (~2009) -- A feed aggregator tool that output data in JSON format
for easy integration with web pages. The team chose Douglas Crockford's JSON
parser over JavaScript's `eval()` function because it was "a little bit safer."

## Explorations

Viget also ran **Explorations** (`explorations.viget.com`), a research and
experimental projects initiative. Combined with Pointless Corp., this shows that
building for the sake of building has been part of Viget's identity from early on.

## Sandstone -- Viget's Homegrown CMS

Viget built a custom content management system called **Sandstone** that was
significant enough to be referenced in public technical articles. It was a real
product used on client projects -- not just a throwaway prototype.

## Tyrant -- Internal Deployment Platform

Viget built an internal Rails application platform called **Tyrant** for
deploying other Rails apps. A custom deployment infrastructure with a
delightfully aggressive name.

## Connect-a-Sketch

An internal or experimental project with heavy JavaScript requirements,
referenced in Brian Landau's 2009 benchmarking article where he tested eight
JavaScript templating libraries with rigorous methodology (1,000 iterations
each, benchmarked 5 times per library).

## EmailLabsClient -- Early Open Source

David Eisinger published an open-source Ruby gem called **EmailLabsClient** on
GitHub in July 2008. GitHub itself had only launched in April 2008, making Viget
among the platform's early adopters.
