# Notable People and Roles

## Leadership

**Brian Williams** -- Co-Founder & CEO. Described as someone who does
"everything from advising our clients to building our conference tables." Yes,
he literally built the company's conference tables. He was personally submitting
SXSW talk proposals about small agency self-promotion, wrote the SpeakerRate
launch post, and was invited to present at Choice Hotels' European convention in
Prague. Influenced by Jason Fried of 37signals (now Basecamp).

**Emily Bloom** -- Now Partner & EVP of People and Culture. One of the driving
forces behind founding Refresh the Triangle when Viget opened the Durham office
in 2007. Her reasoning: "an active, connected community of web professionals is
good for everyone."

## Design and UX

**Jackson Fox** -- VP of UX & Design. Innovated a practice of handing clients
pens and thick markers during kickoff meetings and asking them to draw their
dream website. The thick markers were deliberate -- they physically prevented
clients from getting bogged down in fine details.

**Peyton Crump** -- Former Design Director. Articulated a core Viget design
philosophy: "constraint -- not creativity -- should be the overriding drive
behind our designs." Submitted the SXSW proposal "Design School for Dummies."

**Tom Osborne** -- Design Director, recruited at SXSW 2008. Submitted the SXSW
2009 proposal "Design Appetizers: The Pre-Composition Phase of Design."

**Mindy Wagner** -- Former Design Director. Gave talks on designer-developer
collaboration challenges at Refresh the Triangle.

**TJ Ward** -- Designer, wrote about wireframing methodology and distinct UX
designer / visual designer role separation.

## Engineering

**David Eisinger** -- VP of Development, based in the Durham office. Published
the EmailLabsClient gem on GitHub within months of GitHub's launch. Built
integrations between Unfuddle and external feedback tools.

**Ben Scofield** -- Developer (Former). Led the Developer Day conference
initiative with Relevance. Presented at RailsConf 2007 on "Building and Working
with Static Sites in Ruby on Rails." Advocated internally for Rails adoption.

**Clinton R. Dreisbach** -- Developer (Former). Experimented with behavior-driven
development (BDD) during the Rails 2 era.

**Brian Landau** -- Developer (Former). Published rigorous JavaScript templating
library benchmarks.

**Mark Cornick** -- Developer (Former). Rails migration expertise. Captured the
engineering team's ethos: "After a decade-plus in IT, I'm skeptical of hype and
twice as skeptical of benchmarks."

**M. Jackson Wilkinson** -- (Former). SXSW panelist on design research. Argued
for a "vibrant community with a little bit of riff-raff" over heavy moderation.
Submitted the SXSW proposal "How MacGyver Would Do Design Research."

## Strategy

**Ken Yarmosh** -- (Former). Early thought leader on web experience. Coined/promoted
"Site Experience Optimization" as a counterpoint to traditional SEO. Also notable
for his Red Sox boycott joke in a blog post about targeted advertising.

**Paul Koch** -- Former Data & Analytics Director. In June 2009, defended Twitter
as "moving into an untapped niche as an information aggregator" when mainstream
media was dismissing the platform -- a remarkably prescient take.

**Kevin Vigneault** -- Submitted the SXSW 2009 proposal "Start-up Mistakes: 5
to Avoid, 5 to Make."
