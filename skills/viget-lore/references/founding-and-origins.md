# Founding and Origins

## "A Group of Renegades"

Viget was founded in 1999 by **"a group of renegades from Blue Chip tech
companies"** based just outside Washington, DC, in Falls Church, Virginia (4th
Floor, 105 W Broad St). The founding wasn't a corporate spinoff -- it was an
entrepreneurial breakaway by people who left established tech companies to build
something of their own.

## The "Viget Labs" Era

The company originally operated under the name **"Viget Labs"** before later
shortening to just **"Viget."** Articles from 2003-2009 consistently use the
longer name. The transition represents a quiet but meaningful brand maturation.

## The Old Tagline

Early articles describe Viget's mission simply as: **"We build web business."**

## "Viget Rhymes with Dig It"

The company has long included a pronunciation guide (with audio!) on their
website because the name trips people up. This branding detail persisted for
years in the site footer.

## Geographic Growth

Viget expanded from its Falls Church HQ to multiple offices:

- **Falls Church / DC Metro** -- original headquarters
- **Durham, NC** -- established by at least 2007-2008
- **Boulder, CO**
- **Chattanooga, TN**

When Viget opened its Durham office, they explicitly wanted to **"shake things
up"** in the local tech community -- and they followed through by founding
Refresh the Triangle (see community-involvement.md).

## Early Hospitality Niche

In its early years, Viget had developed **"extensive experience in developing
web solutions for the hospitality industry"**, including work with "high-profile
restaurants, caterers, and an online culinary portal." This was a notable
specialty before the company diversified more broadly.
