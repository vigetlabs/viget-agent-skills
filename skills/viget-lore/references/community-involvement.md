# Community Involvement

## Refresh the Triangle

When Viget opened its Durham office, they didn't just set up shop -- they
**founded Refresh the Triangle**, a local chapter of the international
"Refreshing Cities" network for web professionals.

- Inaugural meeting: **October 25, 2007**
- First speaker: Jackson Fox
- ~30 attendees at launch
- Emily Bloom was a driving force behind it
- Viget also hosted Startup Weekend events at their office

The meetup became a venue where Viget employees gave talks, including Mindy
Wagner and David Eisinger co-presenting on designer-developer collaboration.

## Refresh DC

Viget's design team (Rob, Peyton, Kendra) actively participated in **Refresh
DC**, a monthly meetup for DC-area web professionals. One referenced event was
hosted by The Motley Fool in Alexandria. Viget used these events for both
community engagement and recruiting.

## Developer Day -- A Nationwide Conference Series

Viget partnered with **Relevance** (another respected consultancy) to create
**Developer Day** -- a low-cost, one-day, technology-agnostic conference series.

In 2009, they held four events across the country:

- **Durham** (March 21) -- keynote by Andy Hunt (co-author of *The Pragmatic Programmer*)
- **DC area** (May 30) -- keynotes by Jay Virdy and Russ Olsen
- **Boston** (August)
- **Boulder** (October)

Featured speakers included industry heavyweights: Stu Halloway, **John Resig**
(creator of jQuery), **Chad Fowler**, and Bruce Eckel.

## SXSW

Viget was a regular presence at SXSW Interactive. Notable moments:

- **SXSW 2008**: The team "had a blast, learned a lot" -- and recruited Tom
  Osborne as their new design director at the event.
- **SXSW 2009**: Seven different Viget employees submitted panel proposals,
  including Brian Williams (CEO). Talk titles included "How MacGyver Would Do
  Design Research" and "Shoe Shopping: The Art of Self-Promotion for Small
  Agencies."
- Samantha moderated a typography panel, Jackson Wilkinson facilitated a design
  research discussion.
- A "Friend of Viget" named Ali Felski won the **SXSW Web Award for Personal
  Portfolio**.

### "SouthByScurvy"

The title of a 2009 article -- "No SouthByScurvy This Year" -- strongly implies
that in a previous year, Viget employees got sick at SXSW badly enough to coin
the term **"SouthByScurvy."**

## Brian Williams in Prague

CEO Brian Williams was invited to present at **Choice Hotels International's
European convention and Technology Summit in Prague**, based on Viget's UX
redesign work for Choice Hotels' international websites.
