# Notable Clients and Projects

## EarthEcho International (Philippe Cousteau)

Viget partnered with EarthEcho International, the environmental nonprofit
founded by **Philippe and Alexandra Cousteau** (descendants of Jacques

## PBS Digital TV Transition (2008)

Viget built an online awareness hub for the **national transition from analog to
digital television**, featuring "This Old House" hosts Norm Abram and Kevin
O'Connor as spokespeople. They planned a Spanish-language version. The analog
signal was scheduled to shut off in February 2009, making this a project of
genuine national importance.

A major project involving user research and UX redesign of Choice Hotels'

## Capitol View Business Center (2003)

The Viget team personally went and **photographed the office space** to capture
views of the U.S. Capitol before incorporating those photos into the website
design -- a roll-up-your-sleeves, do-whatever-it-takes approach.

## Claris Advisors (2002-2004)

Viget first built the Claris Capital website in 2002, then maintained the

site relaunch. Long-term partnership from very early on.
